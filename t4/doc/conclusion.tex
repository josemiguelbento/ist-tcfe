\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment, the objective of making an audio amplifier circuit has been achieved.\par
The circuit created was analysed theoretically using the Octave maths tool, and by circuit simulation, using the
Ngspice tool. The theoretical results obtained differed from those obtained in the simulation analysis. This difference obtained is due to the fact that the models used for the transistors in the theoretical analysis are very different from those used by Ngspice. The transitor models that were used in Ngspice were way more complex than the ones implemented theoretically. 

However due to the overall satisfactory match we can say that the theoretical model is acceptable due to its low complexity and its good results. Note that the main deviation occurred in the ripple computation - the predicted ripple was smaller than the actual ripple encountered in the simulations.\par
 For more complex circuits, the
theoretical and simulation models could differ even more, given that the greater complexity of the models implemented by the simulator Ngspice, as well as the interactions between these, which will be more noticeble when compared to the results obtained using the simpler models studied in the theoretical classes.\par
The final value settled on for the Merit was 16.0613 using the Ngsice's results and 23.2915 using Octave's theoretical results. This may seem like a great discrepancy, but is in fact fully explained by the difference in precision between the ngspice floating point numbers and the octave floating point, along with the the different ripple encountered between simulation and theory.
