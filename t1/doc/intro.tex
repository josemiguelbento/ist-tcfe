% state the learning objective

\par The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit containing independent and 
linearly dependent voltage and current sources. The circuit also contains 7 resistors, totaling 11 components that are conected both in series and in paralel.\par
The circuit has 7 nodes and 4 meshes. The nodes of the circuit were numbered arbitrarily (from {\it$V_{0}$}  to {\it$V_{7}$} ), and it was considered that {\it node 0} was the ground node. The voltage-controlled current source {\it $I_b$} has a linear dependence on Voltage {\it $V_b$} of constant {\it $K_b$}. The voltage {\it $V_b$} is the voltage drop at the ends of resistor {\it $R_3$}. The current-controlled voltage source {\it $V_c$} has a linear dependece on current {\it $I_c$} of constant {\it $K_c$}. The control current {\it $I_c$} is the current that passes through the resistor {\it $R_6$}.
The circuit can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:circuit_t1}.\par
The values for the resistors, the independent sources and the  constants for the dependent 
sources are presented in Table~\ref{tab:python_values}. These values were obtained using the
Python script provided by the professor responsable for the laboratory assigment
and using the number 95815 as the seed.\par

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented using two methodes: the mesh analisys and the nodal analysis. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation using the program Ngspice, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
