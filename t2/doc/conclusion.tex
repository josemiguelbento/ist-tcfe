\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment the objective of analysing a circuit containing a capacitor and a sinusoidal voltage source $v_s$ that  varies in time has been achieved .\par
Static analyses have been performed both theoretically, using the Octave maths tool, and by circuit simulation, using the
Ngspice tool. Not only did the theoretical results obtained using different methods agree perfectly, they also matched the simulation results precisely.\par
The reason for this perfect match is the fact that this is a
straightforward circuit containing only linear components - this implies, as pointed out in the theory classes, that the theoretical
and simulation models cannot differ. For more complex components and circuits, the
theoretical and simulation models could differ (given the greater complexity of the models implemented by the simulator Ngspice, when compared to those studied in the theoretical classes); however, that is not the case for this particular circuit.\par
