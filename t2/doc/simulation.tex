\section{Simulation Analysis}
\label{sec:simulation}
In this section we will describe the steps needed to simulate this circuit using the software Ngspice.Three types of analysis will be performed:Operating Point analysis, Transient analysis ans Frequency analysis.

The following steps in the simulations are to be conducted: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item for $t<0$ (operating point only, in order to obtain the voltages in all nodes and the currents in all branches);
	\item operating point for  $V_s(0) = 0$, replacing the capacitor with a a voltage source $V_x = V_6-V_8$, where $V_6$ and $V_8$ are the voltages in nodes 6 and 8 as obtained in the previous step (this step is necessary given that we must the compute the boundary conditions that guarantee continuity in the capacitor's discharge - such may imply that the boundary conditions differ from those computed for t<0);
	\item simulate the natural response of the circuit (using the boundary conditions V(6) and V(8) as obtained previously) using a transient analysis;
	\item repeating the third step, using {\it $V_s$} as given in \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:time_step}} and f = 1kHz  in order to simulate for the total response on node 6
	\item simulate the frequency response in node 6 for a frequency range 0.1 Hz to 1MHz.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Operating Point Analysis for $t<0$}
There was a need to create a "fictional" voltage source, between node 7 and resistor 6 (providing 0V to the circuit in order not to alter the behaviour of the rest of the circuit) so as to be able to define the dependecy for the current-controlled voltage source {\it $V_d$}. This has no specific reason to be, other than the particularities of the Ngspice software. THe circuit and nodes used for the simulation can be seen in \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:diagram_t2}}.\par 
\textbf{Table~\ref{tab:op}} shows the simulated operating point results for the circuit
under analysis for $t<0$. 
%The current flows considered in the theoretical section were coherent with the polarity implicitly declared when defining the circuit to be simulated in the Ngspice script.\par
